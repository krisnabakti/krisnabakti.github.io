I designed, soldered by hand, and tested Breakout Boards to power and interface data sensors for an autonomous sailing robot boat. Each PCB is attached to an STM-32 nucleoboard that is responsible for different aspects such as the rudder, sail trim tab, and sensor nodes.

### Features:
- Implemented protection circuits, buck converter, high side switching, and communication protocol transceivers
