This miniature crane was built for a high-school physics project to demonstrate the concept of pascal's law in hydraulic systems. By integrating the base of the crane with a motor and adding a linear actuator to drive the syringes, it allows the crane to be operated wirelessly using an ESP-32 module.

### Features:
- Stepper motor integrated at the base to allow 360-degree rotation of the crane
- Dual Continuous Servo Motors connected via a custom 3D-printed Linear Actuator
- ESP32 Remote control via Bluetooth for precise 3-axis control of the main hook
