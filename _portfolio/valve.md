This IoT Smart-Valve was designed as a household device to monitor and control water usage. Since there were leaking pipes inside my house, it is necessary to shut off the water valve at night. Through this device, we are able to reduce the water bill by 30% every month. The device also saves us time in the morning from walking to the physical valve to open the valve again.

### Features:
- A seperate Controller and Actuator Unit, connected via shielded cable.
- Actuator Unit equipped with water flow sensor to measure outgoing flow
- Controller receives instruction and reports water flow information to/from the internet,
- Actuator equipped with custom 3D-printed limit switches to determine it's position
- Timer setting can be enabled to schedule the opening and shutting of the valve
- Volume setting can be enabled to control the volume of water going through the valve
- The percentage position of the valve gate can be controlled to control the debit of water
